- [1948 The Mathematical Theory of Communication](./1948-theory-of-communication-shannon.pdf) by Claude Shannon."The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately
a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer
to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic
aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual
message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each
possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design."

- [1949 The Monte Carlo Method](./1949-MonteCarlo-MetropolsAndUlam.pdf) by Metropolis and Ulam. September 1949 published in the Journal of The American Statistical Association.

- [1953 Equations Of State Calculations by Metropolis and Teller](./1953-EquationsOfStateCalculations-MetropolisAndTeller.pdf). The method consists of a modifed Monte Carlo integration over configuration space.

- [1974 Spurious Regressions In Econometrics](./1974-granger-newbold.pdf) Journal of Econometrics. The point of view we intend  to take is that of the statistical time series analyst, rather than the more classic econometric approach. In this way it is hoped that we might be able to illuminate the problem from a new angle, and hence perhaps present new insights. Accordingly, in the following section we summarize some relevant results in time series analysis. In sect. 3 we indicate how nonsense regressions relating economic time series can arise, and illustrate these points in sect. 4 with the results of a simulation study. Finally, in sect. 5, we re-emphasize the importance of error specification and draw a distinction between the philosophy of time series analysis and econometric methodology, which we feel to be of great importance to practitioners of the latter. 

- [2001 A preprocessing scheme for high-cardinality categorical attributes in classification and prediction problems](./2001-predicting-high-cardinality-barreca.pdf) by Daniele Micci-Barreca. Categorical data fields characterized by a large number of distinct values represent a serious challenge for many classification and regression algorithms that require numerical inputs. On the other hand, these types of data fields are quite common in real-world data mining applications and often contain potentially relevant information that is difficult to represent for modeling purposes.This paper presents a simple preprocessing scheme for high-cardinality categorical data that allows this class of attributes to be used in predictive models such as neural networks, linear and logistic regression. The proposed method is based on a well-established statistical method (empirical Bayes) that is straightforward to implement as an in-database procedure. Furthermore, for categorical attributes with an inherent hierarchical structure, like ZIP codes, the preprocessing scheme can directly leverage the hierarchy by blending statistics at the various levels of aggregation.While the statistical methods discussed in this paper were first introduced in the mid 1950's, the use of these methods as a preprocessing step for complex models, like neural networks, has not been previously discussed in any literature.

- [2011 Category Theoretic Analysis of Hierarchical Protein Materials and Social Networks](./2011-category-theory-protien-spivak.pdf) by David I. Spivak, Tristan Giesa, Elizabeth Wood, Markus J. Buehler. "Here we describe an application of category theory to describe structural and resulting functional properties of biological protein materials by developing so-called ologs. An olog is like a ‘‘concept web’’ or ‘‘semantic network’’ except that it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory."
